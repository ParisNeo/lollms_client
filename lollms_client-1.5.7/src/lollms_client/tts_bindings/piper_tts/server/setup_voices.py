# XTTS Voices Directory

Place your speaker reference WAV files in this directory.

## How to add voices:

1. Record or find WAV files of speakers you want to clone (5-30 seconds recommended)
2. Name them descriptively (e.g., "john.wav", "sarah.wav", "narrator.wav")
3. Place them in this directory
4. The voice name will be the filename without extension

## Requirements for voice files:
- WAV format
- 22050 Hz sample rate (recommended)
- Mono or stereo
- Good quality, clear speech
- 5-30 seconds duration
- Single speaker

## Example usage:
```python
# Use a custom voice file named "john.wav"
audio = tts.generate_audio("Hello world", voice="john")
```

## Getting sample voices:
You can:
1. Record your own voice
2. Use text-to-speech to create reference voices
3. Extract audio clips from videos/podcasts (respect copyright)
4. Use royalty-free voice samples

Note: XTTS works by cloning the voice characteristics from the reference file.
