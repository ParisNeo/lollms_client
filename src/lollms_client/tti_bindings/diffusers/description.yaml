description: |
  A binding for the Hugging Face Diffusers library.
  It allows running a wide variety of text-to-image models locally on your own hardware.
  Models can be downloaded from the Hugging Face Hub or loaded from a local directory.
input_parameters:
  - name: model_name
    type: str
    description: "Hugging Face model ID (e.g., 'stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0') or a folder name for a local model stored in the models_path directory."
    mandatory: true
  - name: models_path
    type: str
    description: "Path to the directory for storing local text-to-image models. Defaults to a 'models' folder inside the binding directory."
    mandatory: false
  - name: hf_cache_path
    type: str
    description: "Path to a directory for Hugging Face to cache downloaded models. If not provided, the default Hugging Face cache location is used."
    mandatory: false
  - name: device
    type: str
    description: "Device for inference. Options: 'auto', 'cuda', 'mps', 'cpu'. Defaults to 'auto', which selects the best available hardware."

  - name: torch_dtype_str
    type: str
    description: "PyTorch data type for model weights. Options: 'auto', 'float16', 'bfloat16', 'float32'. 'auto' is recommended."
    mandatory: false
  - name: use_safetensors
    type: bool
    description: "Whether to prefer loading model weights from '.safetensors' files for improved security and performance. Defaults to true."
    mandatory: false
  - name: scheduler_name

    type: bool
    description: "Enable the model's built-in safety checker to filter potentially NSFW content. Defaults to true."
    mandatory: false
  - name: num_inference_steps
    type: int
    description: "Default number of steps for the generation process. Higher values can improve quality but take longer. Defaults to 25."
    mandatory: false
  - name: guidance_scale
    type: float
    description: "Default Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) scale. Higher values make the image adhere more closely to the prompt. Defaults to 7.5."

    mandatory: false
  - name: enable_cpu_offload
    type: bool
    description: "Offload parts of the model to the CPU to save VRAM, at the cost of slower generation speed. Useful for GPUs with limited memory. Defaults to false."
    mandatory: false
  - name: enable_sequential_cpu_offload
    type: bool
    description: "A more aggressive form of CPU offloading that saves more VRAM but is significantly slower. Defaults to false."
    mandatory: false
  - name: enable_xformers
    type: bool
    description: "Enable xFormers memory-efficient attention to reduce VRAM usage and potentially speed up generation on compatible hardware. Requires xFormers to be installed. Defaults to false."
    mandatory: false
  - name: hf_variant
    type: str
    description: "Specify a model variant from the Hugging Face Hub, such as 'fp16' or 'bf16', if available for the chosen model."
