  A binding for Google's state-of-the-art text-to-image models, including Imagen 3 and Gemini 2.5 Flash.
  This binding supports two methods of authentication:
  1.  **Vertex AI**: For full-featured access, including image editing and inpainting. Requires a Google Cloud project and authentication via Application Default Credentials (ADC). To set this up, run 'gcloud auth application-default login' in your terminal.
  2.  **Gemini API Key**: A simpler method for image generation using a Gemini API key.
