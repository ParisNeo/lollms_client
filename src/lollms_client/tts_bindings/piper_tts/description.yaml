description: |
  This binding integrates the fast, local, and high-quality Piper TTS engine.
  It requires the `piper-tts` library to be installed (or the executable to be
  in the system's PATH).

  Piper uses a set of pre-trained voice models that need to be downloaded locally.
  The `list_voices` method returns a list of available voice keys.
