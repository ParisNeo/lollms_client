  This binding integrates Suno AI's Bark model, a powerful and creative
  generative audio model. Unlike traditional TTS, Bark can generate highly
  expressive speech, music, and non-speech sounds like laughter or sighs.

  Instead of voice cloning, Bark uses a selection of pre-defined "voice presets"
  that can be listed and chosen.

  You can embed non-speech sounds in the text, for example:
  "Hello, my name is Suno, and I like to [laughter] laugh."
