description: |
  This binding integrates the powerful XTTSv2 model from the community-maintained
  TTS library. It excels at zero-shot voice cloning, allowing it to mimic any
  voice from a short (6-15 second) high-quality audio sample.

  The core function `generate_audio` requires a path to a reference WAV file
  to be passed in the `voice` parameter.
